# Blog 

## from Django 3 by example de Antonio Mel√©

- Chapter 1, Building a Blog Application, will introduce you to the framework through a
blog application. You will create the basic blog models, views, templates, and URLs
to display blog posts. You will learn how to build QuerySets with the Django objectrelational
mapper (ORM), and you will configure the Django administration site.

- Chapter 2, Enhancing Your Blog with Advanced Features, will teach you how to handle
forms and ModelForms, send emails with Django, and integrate third-party
applications. You will implement a comment system for your blog posts and allow
your users to share posts via email. The chapter will also guide you through the
process of creating a tagging system.

- Chapter 3, Extending Your Blog Application, explores how to create custom template
tags and filters. The chapter will also show you how to use the sitemap framework
and create an RSS feed for your posts. You will complete your blog application by
building a search engine with PostgreSQL's full-text search capabilities.
